# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of the project is to analyze metrics that can affect the manufacturing a new car prototype and compare vehicle performance across different manufacturer lots. These metrics include vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, AWD capabilities, MPG, and PSI.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

 Three Key Takeaways:
- Variance of a non-random variable is usually 0. Given this fact, the intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance coeeficients can be said to provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.
- At a significance level of 0.05, we are able to reject the null hypothesis because of the extremely small p-value. The null hypothesis of a linear regression states that the slope (β1) is equal to 0. However, if we reject the null hypthesis, we're stating that alternative (β1 ≠ 0) is true. Thus, proving that the slope is not 0.
- Multiple R-squared increases as more variables are passed through the regression. However, adjusted R-squared controls against this increase, and adds penalties for the number of predictors in the model, thus making it a more accurate predictor of how effective the linear model is. An adjusted R-square of 0.6825 concludes that this linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes relatively well.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The overall variance for the entire dataset indicates that the current manufacturing data meets the 100 pounds per square inch variance limitation. However, when separated into three lots, the third lot demonstrates a much higher variance. Because the lots are chosen randomly, there is a possiblity that a third of the lot does not meet the necessary suspension coils requirement.
